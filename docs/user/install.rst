Installation
============

----------------

The recommended way to install the stable version of emcee is using
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U twind
..
    or `conda <https://conda.io>`_

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c conda-forge twind
